    <h1>memo from a poet-technologist</h1>
    <blockquote>
<p>Being does not see itself. Perhaps it listens to itself. It does not stand out, it is not <em>bordered</em> by nothingness: one is never sure of finding it, or of finding it solid, when one approaches a center of being ... Outside and inside are both intimate—they are always ready to be reversed, to exchange their hostility. If there exists a border-line surface between such an inside and outside, this surface is painful on both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Gaston Bachelard </p>
<p>Poetry is an expression of being. It is a way of moving through and showing our inside and outside worlds. Sometimes it acts as a door, sometimes as a bridge, and sometimes it acts as a rift between them. Poetry has a way of both attaching and detaching our being to the geometry of everyday life. A tactful poetics makes this both timeless and universal. This becomes increasingly difficult in the age of information, considering the relationship between the current economy of poetic language and its tendency toward cliché.</p>
<p>Poetry is technology. It is a technology for communication. It evolves alongside our other technologies. Whether it is how we write, distribute, share, or poetry ... the technology of poetry has evolved. In my own poetry, I try not to allow it to be self-referential or to reference the other technologies that surround it. I try not to mention the writing mechanism or tool (the tired clichés of the pen, the typewriter, the keyboard, the screen etc.). That doesn&#39;t mean the technologies I use in my poetry don&#39;t have an effect on it; I just try to avoid embedding it in a time that is changing so very rapidly that anything cited or said yesterday could be antiquated today.</p>
<p>I have been alive for the rapid acceleration of technological progress seen since the dawn of the information age. I have written with pencil, pen, letterpress, typewriter, computer, and smartphone. I have used them all in poetry, and I still utilise all of them today. Each of these tools has their own being and their own way of influencing my writing (how I compose myself and compose my poetry) and changing how I share it (physically or digitally). </p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to get deep into the ontology of the keyboard, computer, or screen. Nor do I want to get into the blurry ontology of our smartphones. Instead, I just want to emphasise that they are tools that I use to quickly disseminate poetic visions and versions of myself and the world around me. It has a democratising effect on my voice and how I share my work. However, the most interesting effect has been on the blurring between the intimate and public–between inside and outside.</p>
<p>Technology has allowed my poetry to inhabit intimate/public and inside/outside spaces at the same time. Knowing this has changed the way that I collect and share poetic moments. It has allowed for me a public archive of intimate thoughts in a way that couldn&#39;t have been possible even thirty years ago. The gatekeeping of literature has become a victim of itself and with the growth of online living through the Internet and social media, poets like myself have been given a new voice.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, it is like whispering things into the void. Painfully living between the inside and the outside. All doors are open, but the outside makes the living room cold, and the home no longer feels safe ... yet at the same time, having the world in your living room has never felt so wonderful. So I have sacrificed that feeling of safety in order to share a bit of myself through poetry while taking advantage of our current toolsets.</p>
<p>We are living out the poetics of cyberspace ... the inside/out and outside/in of everything, where poetry has become a science of being and existing between these two worlds. </p>
