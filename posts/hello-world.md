description: Welcome post on the poetic mapping of the word.

>Beyond
all our thinking and talking,
it isn’t and is. This
is a map of our knowing. Own
nothing. Like breath in your lungs,
the truth passes through you.
Where space, motion and rest
come together is being.

— robert bringhurst

every poem is a map. it is a way of knowing. a way of knowing our way. it is a historical document, an archive, an atlas. 

this is what this blog is about. it is about tracing our meeting trajectories through the language and tools of poetry. it is about mapping. mapping where we have been and creating imaginary maps of where we will go.

welcome to my new website and blog. please read some blog posts or chapbooks and check out my other personalities on the links page. i am glad we have found one another.
