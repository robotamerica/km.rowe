There are ruins here.

Old sites left abandonedâ€”forums, homepages, ringed GIFs glowing like exit wounds in time.

I walk their source code like a graveyard, listening for what still echoes.

Somewhere between the blinking `<marquee>` and the broken `<img>`, something still lingers.

A presence, maybe.

A glitch. A memory. A ghost.
