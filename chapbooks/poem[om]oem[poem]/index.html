      poem[oṃ]oem[poem]

      if there is water
      there is beach
      if there is sky
      and ground
      or sea and sun 
      there is horizon
      if there are mountains
      they like little broccoli heads
      if there are antenna
      then invisible communication
      all about and abound 
      
      if there is sand 
      then sand goes in shoe
      or between pages of book
      or spit goes the oyster
      in pearl glow of day
      
      if there are blackbirds
      crackle and caw 
      
      if the current is wet
      then take us away
      
      first past the post
      lagoon or emerald coast
      we wade wisely in the shallows
      
      if there is tree
      then shade
      
      if there are trees 
      then shapes like combs
      or paint brushes 
      
      if there is wind 
      catch me here or there
      
      if there is beer
      several limes halved and squeezed
      
      it there are glasses 
      please let me read
      
      if there is language
      english or spanish
      let me imagine words 
      and words to describe
      subaquatic says nature
      squiggly or squirmy things
      silver and scaly things
      
      bubbles
      darkness
      brightness
      blue 
      blue-green
      nameless shades
      all liquid skin
      and mysterious
      
      if there are waves
      constant sound 
      somewhere between
      wind and water
      somewhere between
      old television at midnight
      or smartphone fuzz
      all intelligent—we think
      all crafty creatures—we believe
      but brimming with bottomless ego
      we wrong we wrong 
      
      if weather
      let there be saint of climate
      with chefs dying in this heat 
      too hot in the kitchen
      killing themselves for capital
      
      if bones
      unearth them as fossils
      it be nicer that way
      
      if smiles
      not a dentist ad
      but gappy happy
      yellow teeth
      
      left the toothbrush at home
      left the cat alone 
      left the plants unwatered—
      let there be rain
      
      let there be children smarter than we
      let there be animals we dare not eat
      let there be bread
      when you let us eat cake
      let there be leftovers
      wrapped on tinfoil or plastic wrap
      let there be bottles and fill them with wine
      
      if pure sun
      then maybe we will burn
      
      if salsa picante
      please up the ante
      
      if red brick on shore
      please build some more
      
      if there are buses
      tourists and plastic
      if there is palm
      cocoloco and fantastic
      
      if there is day
      let there be night
      but little binaries
      leave us too tight
      
      we are water
      and skin
      and hair
      and teeth
      too many holes
      not to sink
      barely aquatic
      beach bums 
      itchy sandfleas 
      trying to escape 
      islands
      islands
      islands 
      oh boey
      or old bodies
      we march 
      in the blameless heat
      
      if hangnail
      likely pain
      if astral awareness
      stargaze guide 
      if red table
      don't say coca
      if there is noon
      there is somewhere after
      
      splendid swimmer
      or fisherman
      blue web of net 
      late for lagoon
      crabs crafting burrows
      but bird builds a nest 
      not nobody nowhere
      except all here and now
      on big blue marble
      moaning better beat the heat
      
      riptide en let it slide
      just let her take you
      and swim to the side
      foam and fuzz
      and salty spray
      legs burn
      lungs burn
      mouth full of saltwater
      skin stings 
      muscles tight
      ears ring
      vibrating on shore with
      near death kissy kisses
      everything shines
      everything sings
      
      but nothing makes one question mortality
      like an unstable chair
      from six legs to none 
      better buy me a saint
      saint salt 
      saint sun
      or sand 
      saint sea
      or applaud the appalling apostle
      apiary honey sucked starlight
      dripping red from
      blue blue sky
      but science lies as much as
      religion or poetry 
      depending on how you write it
      depending on how you read it
      
      echo me ecology
      or empty me emberto 
      dense attire written to wear
      rather than to be 
      a possibility
      i am wrong 
      but why you so pretty?
      
      if you don't adore the letter q
      then who the fuck are you?
      
      if question
      maybe answer
      or big kiss on mouth 
      or constant consent
      or face the consequence
      
      we can wash yesterday off
      but what of tomorrow
      
      if possibility
      be aggressive
      bee-ee-agressive 
      
      if want none
      wonton soup and some 
      
      i am windbent
      whiplash and whipperwheel
      tone or tone-deaf
      pour a lil on the tombstone
      talk to me toothsayer
      on toffee thick tuesday
      tantamount to humidity
      which is very far from humility
      
      sweet or saltwater
      a sweaty little story 
      water or animalcræft
      hands for pincers 
      walk a little sideways
      snore when we drunk
      
      if there be floss
      let it be candy
      let it be blue
      or pink
      the colour of sky
      depending on what time it is
      
      we are lavender and lily
      worm or beechwood
      i am not known for
      the number of fingers
      or toes i possess
      but maybe i should be
      
      maybe i talk too much
      when i should listen
      
      maybe my shoulder is
      sore with age
      
      but if sandles 
      don't let me be toeless
      
      shade is important
      mostly when you need it
      
      we got ice
      all sorts of ice
      so long as it's cubed
      
      don't be fooled
      by these rocks i got
      i'm still kevvy from the block
      
      kevvy metal and other lead boots
      
      if tomorrow
      then it's today
      
      if today
      it's no longer yesterday
      
      left money in my pocket before laundry
      i'm that kind of forgetful
      
      part with me palapa
      purpose like paella 
      and pass the feelings by
      
      if prairie rose 
      then show me your hips
      built bravely we machines
      like tractor
      like four by four
      shuck me an oyster
      or hock me a chuckwagon
      
      but we are near sea
      and somehow always above it
      
      cause & effect is a crocodile
      or a clock gone tick-tock
      but now we got them phones
      smart silent killers 
      like shark
      like disease
      
      gertrude stein
      or seinfeld
      got yer costanzas
      in meditation
      
      coral or correlate
      or collate the conditions
      think of all the wonderful
      ways we anthropomorphise
      the incredible crustaceans
      or just make them edible
      
      if there is bait
      there is fishing
      tackle and gear me
      or reel me in
      closer to shore
      to perceive the pelican
      brief as she dives
      better at fishing
      than we are 
      efficient & effective
      imitate and intonate
      we've learned everything
      from natural nature
      
      give me a hand
      clap hands 
      hand me a beer
      handifolk on vacation
      
      i wrote but i can't poet
      
      proper poets
      teach at universities
      and have fancy degrees
      or host boring podcasts
      or have editors and publishers
      
      proper poets
      don't eat fast food
      
      proper poets
      probably don't eat tacos
      because proper poets 
      got class and grammar
      
      proper poets 
      all got that same voice
      where did that come from?
      
      proper poetry
      is theft and don't
      dare tell me otherwise
      
      proper poets 
      burn at the beach
      lobsters at the boil
      
      no proper poetry here
      or maybe, but that's contestable
      
      breakwater and levy it fast
      
      i am approximately
      75,000 enzymes strong 
      with a set of rattling teeth
      hungry for seafood
      
      came across 
      beach side conversation
      about lorca:
      proper poets got good teeth
      oral hygiene is important
      lorca had too many cavities
      teeth not white enough
      that's why the facsists killed him
      
      maybe we better as 
      spaghetti western?
      maybe if we wander less
      and wonder more ...
      
      wick a wish a candlestick
      and pass me the tv dinner
      
      if sandcastle
      studies architecture
      
      if young
      smart
      animalwise
      prime 
      a proper
      home 
      
      if Instagram
      then barely living
      
      two thumbs
      to keep the score
      
      if green
      i'd rather not kale
      kelp it together kevin
      
      if beach not enough
      drive to the mountains
      purify me pine
      just don't enable me
      
      pry me another hour
      with the crowbar of today
      and just like little fishies
      i'll swim to swim away.
      
      poempoem or pom pom
      almost baby after prom prom
      
      all alberta boi
      or alpha centauri 
      triple eh beef
      ground or chuck round
      i am impossible in too many ways
      
      i'm feeling driftwood
      stranded on beach
      or all log driver's waltz
      
      or just fresh cut pine
      gone birling down
      en down whitewater
      or just stepping lightly
      
      well opine the pinebeatle 
      in ten words or less
      i double dare you
      
      please me prairie
      or leave me on the lark
      celebrate the cephalopods
      or give em the goat
      
      we are a few tentacles 
      short of a rodeo 
      but we here anyway
      
      under sun
      in warm water
      lazy lagoon
      gusty gulf
      low tide
      and bona fide
      
      if not veracruz
      then where?
      
      happy in xalapa
      and fuck new york
      poets anyway 
      
      orchid or are you kidding me
      i've bloomed in much harsher places
      
      she be cut so
      stitch her with literature
      and pack my mouth with poems
      
      i am a catalogue of worn parts
      
      only mobile cause i can be
      and there is my privilege
      and it disgusts me
      
      sugerchide and gest me
      palm—cane—coconut
      all caffeine and sangre
      we are only old as the
      last story told
      
      and at this moment
      none short nor tall
      nope i've none left for y'all
      
      but if a single cloud
      then sing the moon to come
      sing sweet lil birdie
      sing the day is done.
